## Structural Design Patterns

It can be kind of tricky to remember all the structural design patterns as they are almost similar to one another.

_I have used a different use case example for each scenario, so that it is easy to understand._

### Adapter Pattern ###

Adapter design pattern is built in such a way that it allows two different interfaces which are considered to be 
incompatible can work with each other without tampering the existing classes.

[Refer to Example](AdapterExample.java)

### Proxy Pattern ###

### Facade Pattern ###

### Bridge Patten ###

### Decorator Patten ###

### Composite Pattern ###

### Flyweight Pattern ###
